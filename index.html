               <p>Planning and research play a essential part when determining where to start on building a custom PC. I utilized tons of Google and Youtube searches to help guide me along the way. 
                  There are several options, configurations, and styles that it can at first seem a bit overwhelming. With the experience and knowledged that I have acquired over the past few years 
                  hopefully I can help guide you to starting your first PC build.

               <p>Figuring out why I wanted to build a PC for was the first step I took. I am an avid gamer and wanted to get the most visually stunning graphics possible. Researching what type of 
                  hardware I needed took quite a bit filtering through many Youtube videos and Google search links. Building and creating a budget is key as the old saying goes "You get what you pay 
                  for", this is particularly true when it comes to PC components. Consider the type of games you like to play then consider what their graphical limits are and how far you want to 
                  push their performance. Then consider the style you want.

               <p>The most enjoyable part about planning your PC build is all of the cool tech you can now start to acquire. After the research and planning I was ready to purchase all of my components.
                  Comparing prices with different vendors, checking compatibility, and selecting the style included more research to insure all of the components worked together. You have to consider monitor 
                  size, GPU size, CPU performance, cooling options, memory options, power source, and even a type of casing to house all of the parts. During COVID many items were on back order, out of stock, 
                  or victim to price gouging which delayed my build by months. I recommend price comparisons, pre-order options, and a lot of patience !

               <h2>Building and Installation</h2>
               <p>Now the fun begins. You will need a few basic tools to assist in the bulid 
                  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Mako-Driver-Kit--64-Precision-Bits/IF145-299?o=4/">iFixit Mako driver kit</a> provides all the essentials you'll need at a decent price. You want to 
                  plan you build in sections, in order,  and be sure to take your time. This process can be somewhat time consuming especially if it's your first build, I did a ton of research for this particular 
                  part as it includes many components and steps. You will need to install a Windows Operating System in order for your PC to run any programs. Have confidence in yourself as you are about to 
                  create you very own PC from scratch a feat not very many believe they can do. I provided a link to the tool kit I used and a very helpful Youtube link below to give you a visual guide from start to finish.

               <p>So we planned our whole build, we researched what type of components we needed, and we should have a PC built. Now its time to power on the PC install the operating system and start testing.
                  Its good practice to ensure all drivers are updated, all necessary apps are installed, and to generally make sure everything is running properly. During my first build I ran into some software 
                  issues and had to do some research on how to resolve them, luckily it wasn't anything too serious. This was a brief overview of my process of building my first Gaming PC, I hope you enjoyed 
                  this website as its the first time I built and designed one as well. </p>
